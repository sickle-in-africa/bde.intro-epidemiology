### What is Epidemiology?
Epidemiology as a health science is not so well known as medicine but has a huge impact on our lives. For example, medical epidemiologists have been credited with adding 25 years to the average life expectancy of people living in the United States since 1947. Studies have made headline news on hormonal drugs and breast cancer, drivers using cell phones, COVID-19, fire retardants in consumer products and many more topics; we wear masks in public, sanitise regularly, and practice social distancing to "flatten the curve" during the COVID-19 pandemic in part because of epidemiology studies. 

To better understand how epidemiology contributes to society we need to consider its role in **public health**: a multidisciplinary field whose goal is to promote the health of the population through organised community efforts. In contrast to medicine, which focuses mainly on treating illness in individuals, public health focuses on preventing illness in the community. Key public health activities include assessing the health status of the population, diagnosing its problems, searching for the causes of those problems, and designing solutions for them. The solutions usually involve community-level interventions that control or prevent the cause of the problem. For example, public health interventions include establishing educational programs to discourage teenagers from smoking, implementing screening programs for the early detection of cancer, and passing laws that require automobile drivers and passengers to wear seat belts.

The scientific basis of public health activities mainly comes from:
1. the basic sciences, such as pathology and toxicology; 
2. the clinical or medical sciences, such as internal medicine and paediatrics; 
3. the public health sciences, such as epidemiology, environmental health science, health
education, and behavioural science. 

Research in these three areas provides complementary pieces of a puzzle that, when properly assembled, provide the scientific foundation for public health action. Other fields such as engineering and economics also contribute to public health. The three main areas approach research questions from different yet complementary viewpoints, and each field has its own particular strengths and weaknesses. Thus Epidemiology is a science that provides one of several sources of knowledge for public health. 

The rapid growth in the scope and ability to link multiple large static and streamed data sets such as *electronic health care records* provides opportunities and challenges for epidemiologists. As data sets become increasingly larger and more complex, epidemiologists will need advanced skills to link, manage, map, analyse, interpret, display, and communicate their findings to both lay and professional audiences and in both oral and written formats. Genomics is also entering the domain of epidemiological research; genome wide association studies can reach as many as 200,000 participants, and through these studies investigators address many of today's epidemiological questions. 

But what is epidemiology? And how is it different from pubic health? In the following box we present a widely accepted definition.

> ## Epidemiology definition
> **Epidemiology** is the study of the distribution and determinants of disease frequency in human populations and the application of this study to control health problems.

We will clarify what we mean by these new terms, like "populations", "disease frequency" and "distribution" in the next few paragraphs, but for now note that epidemiology is concerned with *populations and disease*.

### Populations
Above we have seen that epidemiologists study how disease can arise in populations. A **population** is a set of people that share one or more common characteristics, such as gender, place of residence, age, or use of certain medical services. For example, the set of all women under 50 living in Abuja is a population. The set of all people with the homozygous sickle cell mutation HbSS is another example of a population. A simple and useful measure of a population is its size: the number of people in the group. Estimates of a population size can often be obtained from census records or health registries.

It can be sometimes difficult to estimate the size of a population, especially if the the geographic spread is large, and it can also be a challenge to define the right population for a given study. Imagine you decide to study the effects of exercise for heavy smokers on their life expectancy. How we chose to define "heavy smoking" will affect who is considered for the study (i.e. the population) and who is not. 

A unifying framework for thinking about a population is whether its membership is permanent or transient. A population whose membership is permanent is called a **fixed** population. Its membership is always defined by a life event. For example, the people in were in Hiroshima, Japan, when the atomic bomb exploded at the end of World War II are members of a fixed population. This population will never gain any new members because only people who were at this historical event can be members. A **dynamic** population is a population who's members can change. Recall the populations we discussed above: the set of all women under 50 living in Abuja is clearly a dynamic population, since women are born, immigrate, emigrate, or die each day and this changes the population size. 

> ## Challenge
> Is the set of all HbSS patients in the world a fixed or dynamic population?
> > ## Solution
> > Clearly no patients can migrate in or out of the population because it covers the whole world, but it is certainly dynamic because new HbSS children are born every day.

In conducting an epidemiology study, it is rare that we will be able to examine or monitor every member of a population. In practice, we need to obtain a sample that faithfully represents the population. A **sample** of a population is a subset of the group where each member in the sample is chosen at random from the population, so that the statistics of the sample are suitably close to the statistics of the population. The question of whether or not the sample is "suitably close" is an important issue for statisticians that must be treated with care. 

### What are the goals of Epidemiology?

Let us revisit our epidemiology definition. It mentions the frequency, distribution, determinants, and control of a disease. We will look at these terms in more detail now. 

**Disease frequency** refers to quantifying how often a disease arises in a population. Counting, which is a key activity of epidemiologists, includes three steps: 
1. developing a definition of disease,
2. instituting a mechanism for counting cases of disease within a specified population,
3. and determining the size of that population.

National disease registries, for example the Sickle Pan African Research Consortium (SPAN) Nigeria database, are a key resource for estimating the frequency of disease in a population. 

**Disease distribution** refers to the analysis of disease patterns according to the characteristics of person, place, and time, in other words, who is getting the disease, where it is occurring, and how it is changing over time. Variations in disease frequency by these three characteristics provide useful information that helps epidemiologists understand the health status of a population; formulate hypotheses about the determinants of a disease; and plan, implement, and evaluate public health programs to control and prevent adverse health events. In the SPAN Nigeria database, the locations of each patient is recorded along with clinical information, thus allowing epidemiologists to analyse how the frequency of the disease varies with location. 

**Disease determinants** are factors that bring about a change in a person’s health or make a difference in a person’s health. Thus, determinants consist of both causal and preventive factors. Determinants also include individual, environmental, and societal characteristics. Individual determinants consist of a person’s genetic makeup, gender, age, immunity level, diet, behaviours, and existing diseases. For example, the risk of breast cancer is increased among women who carry genetic alterations, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2; are elderly; give birth at a late age; have a history of certain benign breast conditions; or have a history of radiation exposure to the chest. Within the population of sickle cell patients, several important factors have been known to affect their quality of life, such as co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia, or mutations in genes related to production of fetal haemoglobin. 

Epidemiologists accomplish **disease control** through epidemiological research, as described previously, and through surveillance. The purpose of surveillance is to monitor aspects of disease occurrence that are pertinent to effective control. For example, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention collects information on the occurrence of HIV infection across the United States. For every case of HIV infection, the surveillance system gathers data on the individual’s demographic characteristics, transmission category (such as injection drug use or male-to-male sexual contact), and diagnosis date. These surveillance data are essential for formulating and evaluating programs to reduce the spread of HIV.

Epidemiologists therefore define count members of populations and asses the frequency of disease in these populations. They look at how this frequency can change from place to place, or time to time. Medical and biological studies can assist with working out what factors might be influencing the disease, and then control measures can be introduced that either address the areas where the frequency is highest, or in a way that the most important determinants can be be eliminated. 

### How does Epidemiology apply to Sickle Cell Disease? 

The SPAN database in Nigeria has been instrumental in measuring the prevalence of sickle cell disease across the country, and could highlight optimal ways to control commodities such as stoke or infection. The database holds around 13,000 records, making it an example of big data in epidemiology. Sickle cell disease registries in other countries like Tanzania and Ghana record similar information and will reveal comorbidity patterns in different parts of the continent. The haplotype background of the sickle mutation, as well as changes in environment and lifestyle, can influence quality of life, hence these registries will reveal different patterns of comorbidity frequency and distribution that will in turn inform the best pubic health decisions for sickle cell patients locally. 

Newborn screening programs for sickle cell disease, such as the program in Ghana, is crucial for protecting HbSS newborns in the first months and years of life. Such programs have been informed by epidemiology studies, and will continue to be a source of information to future studies. Patient support groups and the dissemination of important information about patient care are both community efforts that rely on information gleaned from epidemiology studies.
